    <h2>The Bass Guitar</h2>
    <p>Here are some descriptions of the most important parts of your bass guitar.</p>
    <img src="images/bass diagram.jpg" width="75%" style="margin-bottom: 20px;" />
    <div class="list">
      <p><span class="smallbullet">Pickups - </span>These magnetic devices capture the
        vibrations of your strings and convert them into electric signals. The sound
        goes out of your guitar, through the cable, and into the amplifier where it is
        processed.
      </p>
      <p><span class="smallbullet">Frets - </span>You play a note by pressing your finger
        on a fret and picking the string with your other hand. Each fret plays a different
        note like keys on a keyboard.
      </p>
      <p><span class="smallbullet">Output Jack - </span>Your 1/4" cable plugs in here and connects
        to the input of your amplifier.
      </p>
      <p><span class="smallbullet">Tuning Keys - </span>Each tuning key tightens/loosens a string. Look at
        the string post each key is connected to identify which string it tunes. When the bass is in
        playing position, turn the key away from you to tighten the string and raise the pitch of the string.
        Turn the key towards you to lower the pitch. (Away from you is the same as away from the body of the bass)
      </p>
      <p><span class="smallbullet">Volume/Tone Controls - </span>If you have a passive bass guitar
        then your bass will only have the two volume/tone control knobs. Which one is which will depend
        on your specific guitar. Volume simply controls the loudness of your bass. Tone control reduces the amount
        of treble on your bass, i.e. the amount of high range in your sound.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <h2>The Amplifier</h2>
    <p>These are the most common knobs and settings on most amps. Refer to your amp's manual
      for specific settings unique to your amplifier.
    </p>
    <img src="images/amp diagram.png" width="75%" />
    <div class="list">
      <p><span class="smallbullet">Input - </span>Plug your cable in here.
      </p>
      <p><span class="smallbullet">Gain - </span>How strongly the amp actually amplifies your signal.
        Generally, this makes your bass <strong>louder</strong> but also makes the sound dirtier. Very high gain
        can cause distortion, which is used in some rock music.
      </p>
      <p><span class="smallbullet">Overdrive - </span>Makes your bass sound crunchy and distorted.
        <strong>Drive</strong> controls how crunchy you want your bass. <strong>Level</strong> controls volume.
      </p>
      <p><span class="smallbullet">Equalization - </span>Controls the levels of the different frequencies
        within your bass's sound. You can compare the frequencies to the different strings on your bass.
        Bass will boost your lowest notes, played on your thickest string. Low mid your next thickest and etc.
      </p>
      <p><span class="smallbullet">Master - </span> The master volume control.
      </p>
      <p><span class="smallbullet">Other - </span> Buttons like bright, contour, and vintage will be unique
        to your amp and will add more effects to your sound.
      </p>
    </div>
    <img src="images/back.png" width="75%" />
    <div class="list">
      <p><span class="smallbullet">Input Power - </span>Plug your power cord (included with amp) in here.
      </p>
      <p><span class="smallbullet">Power - </span>Turn on and off.
      </p>
      <p><span class="smallbullet">Aux In - </span>Plug in an aux cable and you can play music through the amp
        to play along with.
      </p>
      <p><span class="smallbullet">Phones - </span>Redirect output sound to headphones for silent practice.
      </p>
      <p><span class="smallbullet">Other - </span> Refer to your amp manual for other plugs.
