    <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h2>No Sound</h2>
    <p>Your amp, guitar, or cable could be faulty. First try unplugging
      and replugging in everything from the 1/4" cables to the power cords
      on your amp. Next check your bass settings - make sure
      the volume knob is turned up. Check your amp's volume and gain as well.
      If all else fails, try taking your gear to a local music store for repairs.
    </p>
    <h2>Fret Buzz</h2>
    <p>Make sure when you push on the fret, you are placing your finger above
      the fret (i.e. towards the headstock) but also as close to the fret as possible.
      Refer to the images in the <a href="before.html">Before You Start Playing</a> section.
       Also try to push harder and see if the buzz goes away.
      If the buzz persists after trying both tips and no amount of pressure
      can reduce buzz, the neck might be warped. Take the bass to a shop
      for truss rod adjustment.
    </p>
    <h2>Just Sounds Bad</h2>
    <p>
      Since you're just starting, everything is going to sound bad. 
      At least you're not learning violin! Your tone will improve with 
      practice and as your fingers gain strength. In the beginning,
      don't worry about speed and focus mainly on getting clean sounding
      notes by pressing firmly with your fretting hand and picking strongly
      with your other hand.
    </p>
    <h2>Finger Pain and Blisters</h2>
    <p>Take frequent breaks to let your hands and wrists get used to
      the new instrument. Eventually, you will get blisters. Option 1 - 
      you wait a week for them to go away. Option 2 - you disinfect your
      favorite sharp utensil and pop them so that you can recover faster.
      Either way, blisters are good since a blister now equals a callus later.
    </p>
    <h2>Broken Strings</h2>
    <p>Buy a new set of bass strings, look into either roundwound or
      flatwound strings. Further information and tutorials lie on YouTube.
